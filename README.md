### Hi, I’m Alex and I'm a nanotechnology engineer
🔬 I’m interested in mostly computational simulations of 2D systems, condensed matter physics, optoelectronic properties of nanomaterials and photonics.\
💻 I've worked on the radiation-matter interactions at a anode-electrolyte interface and calculations with graphene quantum dots.\
👀 Currently I'm a PhD student in photonics, focusing on ultrashort laser pulses and the radiation-matter interaction of this with different colloidal nanoparticles and in-situ detection of properties of nanomaterials using complex beam shaping in pulsed laser ablation in liquids.
